Guidelines for Participation in CLEF 2001 

Guidelines for Participation in the Cross Language Evaluation Forum: CLEF 2001 

CLEF 2001 consists of 4 tasks:

1. Multilingual Information Retrieval 
2. Bilingual Information Retrieval 
3. Monolingual (non-English) Information Retrieval 
4. Domain-Specific Information Retrieval (GIRT) 
An experimental track on interactive cross-language system evaluation is also 
being organized with separate guidelines. Please contact Doug Oard (oard@glue.umd.edu) 
or Julio Gonzalo (julio@lsi.uned.es) to join this task. 

CLEF 2001 has comparable document collections for national newspapers in 6 
languages: Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Spanish.

The main topic set consists of 50 topics and is prepared in: English, French, 
German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Japanese (main languages) and Swedish, Finnish 
and Chinese (additional topic languages).

The original topic set is prepared in EN, ES, FR, DE, IT, NL on the basis of the 
contents of the collections and consists of a selection of topics of local (i.e. 
national), European, and general interest. This means that the number of 
relevant documents in any one collection can vary considerably, depending on the 
topic; in some cases, for a particular topic, there may be no relevant documents 
in a given collection. Japanese topics have also been prepared; the aim is to 
encourage the participation of Asian groups interested in European languages and 
vice versa.

Topics in other languages are translated from the original topics by independent 
translators (i.e. not belonging to participating groups). 

Topics are released using the correct diacritics (according to the language). 

Since the documents for this year?s CLEF experiments come from well-known high-quality 
sources, they should have a very small error-rate with respect to accents. 
However, participants should still be prepared for accent mismatches. This 
constitutes a real-world problem. Note that accents may be transcribed if this 
is common practice in the area of origin of the documents. In particular, the 
accents in one of the Italian collections (La Stampa) are indicated by a 
following apostrophe (') as a final character whereas in the other (SDA) the 
correct accented chracters are used. The English topics are generally written in 
British English, however, the English documents are from the US; there can thus 
be a lexical and orthographic mismatch. Systems must be sufficiently robust to 
cater for such features (very common in real world situations).

25 topics are prepared in English, German and Russian for the GIRT task. 

The goals of the tasks are as follows: 

1. Multilingual: Selecting a topic set in any language, retrieve relevant 
documents from the multilingual collection of English, French, German, Italian 
and Spanish newswires and newspapers and submit the results in a single merged 
and ranked list. 
2. Bilingual: There are two bilingual tasks in CLEF 2001: 
X => English collection 
X => Dutch collection 
Selecting any topic language with the exception of the target collection 
language, retrieve relevant documents from the chosen target collection and 
submit the results in a ranked list. 
3. Monolingual (non-English): Query the Dutch, French, German, Italian or 
Spanish collections using topics in the same language and submit results in a 
ranked list. 
4. GIRT: Query the GIRT collection (German social science data which also 
provides additional translations of the document titles into English): 
a. as a monolingual task ? German topics against German GIRT data; 
b. as a bilingual task ? English or Russian topics against German GIRT data. 

In the case of b) other topic languages can be used if an independent 
translation of the topic language is provided. In particular, if English is used, 
an English-German thesaurus is available. If Russian is used, a German-Russian 
translation table is available. Another variation of this task could be to 
include the indexing terms from the "controlled-term" and "free-term" fields in 
the retrieval process; this must be indicated. General information on the domain-specific 
task and the GIRT data is given in an article by Gey and Kluck. Additional 
information on the GIRT task data structure and thesaurus is available here. For 
any questions on the GIRT task contact Michael Kluck (kluck@bonn.iz-soz.de). 

The evaluation methodology adopted for CLEF is an adaptation of the strategy 
studied for the TREC ad-hoc task. The instructions given below have been derived 
from those distributed by TREC. We hope that they are clear and comprehensive. 
However, please do not hesitate to ask for clarifications or further information 
if you need it. Send queries to carol@iei.pi.cnr.it.



CONSTRUCTING AND MANIPULATING THE SYSTEM DATA STRUCTURES

The system data structures are defined to consist of the original documents, any 
new structures built automatically from the documents (such as inverted files, 
thesauri, conceptual networks, etc.), and any new structures built manually from 
the documents (such as thesauri, synonym lists, knowledge bases, rules, etc.). 

1. The system data structures may not be modified in response to CLEF 2001 
topics. For example, you cannot add topic words that are not in your dictionary. 
The CLEF tasks represent the real-world problem of an ordinary user posing a 
question to a system. In the case of the cross-language tasks, the question is 
posed in one language and relevant documents must be retrieved whatever the 
language in which they have been written. If an ordinary user could not make the 
change to the system, you should not make it after receiving the topics. 
2. There are several parts of the CLEF data collections that contain manually-assigned, 
controlled or uncontrolled index terms. These fields are delimited by SGML tags. 
Since the primary focus of CLEF is on retrieval of naturally occurring text over 
language boundaries, these manually-indexed terms should not be indiscriminately 
used as if they are a normal part of the text. If your group decides to use 
these terms, they should be part of a specific experiment that utilizes manual 
indexing terms, and these runs should be declared as manual runs. 
3. Only the following fields may be used for automatic retrieval: 
Frankfurter Rundschau: TEXT, TITLE only 
Der Spiegel: TEXT, LEAD, TITLE only 
La Stampa: TEXT, TITLE only 
Le Monde: TEXT, LEAD1, TITLE only 
LA TIMES: HEADLINE, TEXT only 
NRC Handelsblad: P only (or alternatively TI, LE, TE, OS only) 
Algemeen Dagblad: P only (or alternatively TI, LE, TE, OS only) 
EFE: TITLE, TEXT only 
German/French/Italian SDA: TX, LD, TI, ST only 
GIRT: TEXT, TITLE only 


GUIDELINES FOR CONSTRUCTING THE QUERIES 

The queries are constructed from the topics. Each topic consists of three fields: 
a brief title statement; a one-sentence description; a more complex narrative 
specifying the relevance assessment criteria. Queries can consist of 1 or more 
of these fields. 

There are many possible methods for converting the supplied topics into queries 
that your system can execute. We have broadly defined two generic methods, "automatic" 
and "manual", based on whether manual intervention is used or not. When more 
than one set of results are submitted, the different sets may correspond to 
different query construction methods, or if desired, can be variants within the 
same method. 

The manual query construction method includes BOTH runs in which the queries are 
constructed manually and then run without looking at the results AND runs in 
which the results are used to alter the queries using some manual operation. The 
distinction is being made here between runs in which there is no human 
involvement (automatic query construction) and runs in which there is some type 
of human involvement (manual query construction). It is clear that manual runs 
should be appropriately motivated in a CLIR context, e.g. a run where a 
proficient human simply translates the topic into the document language(s) is 
not what most people think of as cross-language retrieval.

To further clarify this, here are some example query construction methodologies, 
and their correct query construction classification. Note that these are only 
examples; many other methods may be used for automatic or manual query 
construction. 

1. queries constructed automatically from the topics, the retrieval results of 
these queries sent to the CLEF results server --> automatic query construction 
2. queries constructed automatically from the topics, then expanded by a method 
that takes terms automatically from the top 30 documents (no human involved) --> 
automatic query construction 
3. queries constructed manually from the topics, results of these queries sent 
to the CLEF results server --> manual query construction 
4. queries constructed automatically from the topics, then modified by human 
selection of terms suggested from the top 30 documents --> manual query 
construction 

Note that by including all types of human-involved runs in the manual query 
construction method we make it harder to do comparisons of work within this 
query construction method. Therefore groups are strongly encouraged to determine 
what constitutes a base run for their experiments and to do these runs (officially 
or unofficially) to allow useful interpretations of the results. For those of 
you who are new to CLEF, unofficial runs are those not turned into CLEF but 
evaluated using the trec_eval package available from Cornell University. (See 
last year's CLEF papers for examples of use of base runs.) 


WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR RESULTS

Your results must be sent to the CLEF results server (address to be communicated). 
Results have to be submitted in ASCII format, with one line per document 
retrieved. 
The lines have to be formatted as follows:
10 Q0 document.00072 0 0.017416 runidex1
1  2  3              4 5        6 


The fields must be separated by ONE blank and have the following meanings:



1) Query number (eliminate any identifying letters). Please only use SIMPLE 
numbers ("1", not "001") 
INPUT MUST BE SORTED NUMERICALLY BY QUERY NUMBER.

2) Query iteration (will be ignored. Please choose "Q0" for all experiments).

3) Document number (content of the <DOCNO> tag.).

4) Rank 0..n (0 is best matching document. If you retrieve 1000 documents per 
query, rank will be 0..999, with 0 best and 999 worst). Note that rank starts at 
0 (zero) and not 1 (one).
MUST BE SORTED IN INCREASING ORDER PER QUERY.

5) RSV value (system specific value that expresses how relevant your system 
deems a document to be. This is a floating point value. High relevance should be 
expressed with a high value). If a document D1 is considered more relevant than 
a document D2, this must be reflected in the fact that RSV1 > RSV2. If RSV1 = 
RSV2, the documents may be randomly reordered during calculation of the 
evaluation measures. Please use a decimal point ".", not a comma. Do not use any 
form of separators for thousands. The only legal characters for the RSV values 
are 0-9 and the decimal point. 
MUST BE SORTED IN DECREASING ORDER PER QUERY.

6) Run identifier (please chose an unique ID for each experiment you submit). 
Only use a-z, A-Z and 0-9. No special characters, accents, etc. 
The fields are separated by a single space. 
The file contains nothing but lines formatted in the way described above. 
An experiment that retrieves a maximum of 1000 documents each for 20 queries 
therefore produces a file that contains a maximum of 20000 lines. If you 
knowingly retrieved less than 1000 documents for a topic, please state so in the 
README file you sent with the run. 
A README file for every run submitted must be sent to the result submission site. 
E-mail address and format for this file will be communicated. 
You must accompany your results by a text file which, for each run, clearly 
states the run identifier, the type of run (e.g. multilingual: NL -> EN, FR, DE, 
ES, IT or bilingual: DE->EN, etc?.), and the approach used (e.g. fully automatic, 
manually constructed queries, etc?). 

N.B. We will accept a maximum of 4 runs per task for the multilingual, bilingual 
and GIRT tasks but you must specify run priority. 
We accept up to 5 monolingual experiments (there are 5 languages to choose from) 
but no more than 3 runs for any one of these languages and up to a maximum of 10 
runs in total (specify run priority for each language). This means that a group 
submitting monolingual experiments for all languages cannot send more than two 
runs per language on average. 
In order to facilitate comparison between results, there will be a mandatory run: 
Title + Description (per experiment, per topic language). 

To give an example, if you are doing the X => EN bilingual task, a possible 4 
runs could be: FR -> EN; DE - > EN; IT -> EN; ES - > EN; or 4 different 
experiments with NL -> EN; or 2 different experiments with NL -> EN + 2 
different experiments with DE -> EN. But NOT 4 different experiments with NL -> 
EN + 4 different experiments with DE -> EN and so on ... 

The absolute deadline for submission of results is midnight, Sunday June 10, 
European time. 

You can download the input checker program here. This has been made available by 
TREC and modified to meet the requirements of CLEF. 

A clear description of the strategy adopted and the resources you used for each 
run MUST be given in your paper for the Working Notes. The deadline for receipt 
of these papers is 6 August 2001. The Working Notes will be distributed to all 
participants on registration at the Darmstadt Workshop (3-4 September 2001). 
This information is considered of great importance; the point of the CLEF 
activity is to give participants the opportunity to compare system performance 
with respect to variations in approaches and resources. Groups that do not 
provide such information risk being excluded from future CLEF experiments.
